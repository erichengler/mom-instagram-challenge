# Simon Says Stamp Instagram Challenge Winners

This is an application I'm creating for my Mom who runs an instagram challenge once per month for Simon Says Stamp. She has been running this challenge for 4 years and has to keep track of who has won each month. Currently, she does this using a notebook. 

Due to the nature of the challenge, she does not want anyone to win twice, so every time she wants to pick a winner, she has to go through all of her entries of previous winners in her notebook. To make this a less tedious task, I have created this app that allows her to input a winners name and the date they won, and also search to see if someone has already won. I hope this makes her life easier!
